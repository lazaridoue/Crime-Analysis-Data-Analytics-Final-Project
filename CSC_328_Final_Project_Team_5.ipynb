        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis:** We believe that the level of unemployment  in the US directly correlates with crime rate. For example, the lower the level of unemployment, we would expect for the crime rate to decrease, and for the higher level of unemployment, to have an increase in crime rate. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction to the topic** What would you consider the definition of crime? According to Merriam Webster’s online dictionary, crime can be defined as, “An illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government.” (Merriam-Webster, n.d)). Crime rate then, can be seen as the numerical value of crimes per population. By understanding crime, we can begin to wonder what influences the rate than individuals would engage in criminal activity. Is this an issue of morality, or are we dealing with issues such as survival, individual’s doing what they can with what they have to sustain themselves? We are examining the link between the crime rate and level of unemployment that the US is experiencing. Our hypothesis looks to confirm or reject the idea that the higher the level of unemployment that the US is experiencing, we expect the crime rate to increase. After our analysis, we will also explore social factors that could be indicative of why our hypothesis was supported or rejected by our data analysis. \n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it was of interest to the group:** Given the current economic and political climate of the US, we are interested to know if the two do indeed have a relationship and what that relationship can reveal socially about individuals who do not have employment. For those who do have a job, there is a level of financial certainty and food security that exists, and could help explain through research why those without a job  have a tendency for increased crime. \n",
        "\n",
        "**What we hope to learn from our research:** At the conclusion of our research, we hope to better understand how employment status, race of incarcerated individuals, state, and  crime type are associated between unemployment and overall crime rate. \n",

        "## Data Cleaning\n",
        " In an effort to standardize the datasets, we deleted irrelevant information such as info on 2015, and percentage difference in crime rate from the crime rates excel document. In addition, we had to delete spaces in the unemployment rate of the 50 states for our merge in the data exploration stage. All references will be recorded and their old states will be available for review if needed to ensure that we as the data analysts are doing our part in representing an honest interpretation of real data. \n",

        "## Business Context \n",
        "Crime has been an important topic in the United States for several years. In our project we are focusing on the year of 2014 and the crime rate for all states. We all know that unemployment can cause a great upset in one’s life. As much as we would hope that individuals would be able to find gainful employment that would provide them some security and discourage them from engaging in crime, the reality varies greatly. Thus, we compared how the unemployment rate affects the crime rate. \n",
        "\n",
        "We noticed that individuals working full time on the current minimum wage live approximately $2000 below the federal poverty line.(Scott, n.d.)\n",
        "\n",
        " When an individual lives at or below the poverty line, the risks of engaging in crime diminish as they operate on a survival basis. Drawing upon the preceding observations, unemployment rate can be seen to be correlated with crime rate. In a business perspective, it is important to make gainful employment more attractive to workers who are struggling to discourage criminal activity, and encourage them to remain within the workforce. More workers in the workforce allows for a greater diversification in skills, and ultimately pays off in the long term strategy of organizations everywhere. \n"

        "The data represents a disturbing trend in the United States over African Americans being overly incarcerated compared to their caucasian counterparts. We lack the time to pursue valuable social context, but given our current social climate in the United States, it is very evident that African Americans are being treated very disparingly by law enforcement. \n",

        "## Critique\n",
        "We encountered a fair level of challenge analyzing the data and converting it to workable formats that would fit in our code. We converted some percentages to decimals in the Race and Crime Rate Excel sheet, altered the formatting options in the table, as well as omitted what we considered nonessential data amongst all of our Excel tables. We have provided links to the original sources, but felt it necessary to note here why you would encounter differences between our work and the works we cited.  I would recommend additional sources and to expand the data size of future interpretations of unemployment and crime rate relatedness. We were able to see a relationship through our linear regression model, but granted that we are unaware of which locations in each state that the information was pulled from, there are grey data areas. For example we got the hierarchical view of the states totals between crime and unemployment, but that data would benefit from a breakdown by county, city or select regions in each state. The race data that was found also could have benefitted from additional sources as we only have White, Black, American Indian, and Asian included in the current data set. There are many more nationalities that were either not captured, or were mislabeled to fit the needs of the original collector in the data source. In all of this data as well, we lack valuable social context to help explain the surge in crime/unemployment rates over other areas. Going on the data that we have alone, we can only show that there does seem to be a relationship between Crime Rate and Unemployment, further research would be needed to draw meaningful conclusions as to why that is or isn’t the case. \n"

        "Bryan - The learning process for this project is a lot. I learned a lot especially being able to put all the knowledge that we learned from all of class secessions into this one project. It was while working with the team that I saw how we could be able to draw some conclusions from the data we had which was nice. In this project it gave me a better understanding of using pandas and it's methods and how to better manipulate dataframes. It also helped me learn more about analysis and how to properly read and visualize data. I also learned how to build better and more effective models in this project using Altair. Sadly I wish we had more time to include how education can affect crime rate.\n",

        "Eleni - I started by thinking that we can accomplish lots of things on this project. Ater beginning to work closely I felt like there is not enough time and that there is not much we can do. However, our project worked and I am very proud of the work my teammates and I have put into this. During this project, I learned multiple things. First I worked on collaborating with a team in order to achive a common goal. Also, I learned a lot more about the data analysis methods and how to approach a project from different perspectives. Lastly I learned how to do an effective Exploratory Data Analysis and Data visialization with plotty an matplot.\n",

        "Jeremy - This project became the culmination of my data collection and data exploratory efforts that I have done throughout my academic career. I looked forward to the possibilities that the data could reveal about our given variables, but the time constraints pulled the team and I to a more stripped down and basic analysis of our data. I gained more experience in cleaning data for analysis and performing statistical methods to find relationships between two variables.  I was intrigued to learn that through our data we found a positive relationship between crime and unemployment, and has prompted my curiosity even further to inquire as to why. Could it be that individual's are doing the best with what they have, and to survive they resort to crime rather than employment? Or does crime offer a more lucrative outing than employment in their area due to insignificant compensation packages? Though we don't have more time to explore those questions at length, I can safely say that the project has encouraged me to learn more on my own. "

        "## Conclusion and Discussion\n",
        "With this data there are several things that can be concluded in the data. One, is that crime from the 1960 has been on the steady rise until 1992 and then crime began to decline and stagenate from 1992 to 2014. Two, there is higher crime rates in the southern US and the mid west US. There is also a postive correlation between crime rate and unemployment rate. This could explain why there is higher crime rates in the southern US as most states in the south relied on coal jobs and since coal jobs are slowly dying out then you can expect unemployment level to increase along with crime rate as people will do illegal things to survive or get paid. This could also explain the midwest region as well such as the state Nevada and New Mexico as they have a very high unemployment rate. Another observation that can be made is that poeverty was dropping from 1994-2000 and that was during Bill Clinton's presidency, then from 2001 onwards poverty was on the rise again during Bush's presidency which involed the war with Iraq and Afghanistan."
